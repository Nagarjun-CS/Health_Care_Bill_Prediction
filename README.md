# Healthcare Analysis and Billing Prediction

This project aims to analyze healthcare trends and predict hospital billing amounts based on patient demographics, medical conditions, and other features. Using machine learning, we develop a predictive model for hospital billing and visualize key insights related to healthcare costs, patient conditions, and hospital stays. The repository contains the Python code for the machine learning model and a Tableau dashboard showcasing key healthcare metrics.This project aims to analyze healthcare trends and predict hospital billing amounts based on patient demographics, medical conditions, and other features.
